\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Interface of the core class needed by graphical librairies to send events to the core. 

You are expected to provide an implementation of this interface, in the form of a Core class, used to contain your libraries, both graphical and non-\/graphical.

The core is also responsible for the main game loop, and measuring time between frames, aswell as loading, switching and unloading libraries.

This interface exists to allow an evenmential event handling. When an event is received from a graphical library, it is sent to the core, who first checks if the event is an exit event or a library switch, and if not sends the event to the graphical library.
